## üß† Brain Tumor Detection Generator
### *(Learning Portfolio Project)*

This application is a **deep learning-based brain tumor classifier** built using
**PyTorch** with **EfficientNet-B0 (EffNetB0)** as the backbone model, and **Streamlit**
for the user interface (UI). It classifies **MRI brain scan images** into four categories:

- üß† **Glioma** ‚Äî a type of brain tumor that originates from glial cells, which are the
  supportive tissues of the brain and spinal cord.

- üß† **Meningioma** ‚Äî a tumor that begins in the meninges, the membranes surrounding the
  brain and spinal cord.
  _Source: [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=meningioma)_

- üß† **Pituitary** ‚Äî an abnormal growth in the pituitary gland, a small gland at the base
  of the brain. Most pituitary tumors are benign (non-cancerous) and slow-growing, but
  they can still cause issues by affecting hormone production or pressing on nearby
  structures in the brain.

- ‚úÖ **No Tumor**

The model is trained on the **BRISC2025** dataset from Kaggle.
